In this post we will be comparing two graphs, a graph with positive (sentiment) words, and one with negative. We will be using the gutenbergr package in R, but this time we will be dealing with the book Dracula. First let's import the packages we will be working with:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
library(gutenbergr)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

To get our data cleaned up and ready to work with sentiments, we will do the following:

```{r}
#Dracula is number 345 in the gutenbergr database
dracula<-gutenberg_download(345)

# Strip each word from the text
dracula_words<-dracula%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)

#The gutenberg id column is unnecessary, so remove it
dracula_words$gutenberg_id<-NULL
```

Bing is a sentiment set that provides a list of words and classifies each word as positive, or negative. Let's first bring 'bing' to a data frame and inner join the words and bing, as to classify each word:

```{r}
bing<-get_sentiments('bing')

dracula_words<-inner_join(dracula_words,bing)

dracula_words
```

## Positive Sentiments
Let's first build a graph based on only the positive sentiment words:

```{r}
dracula_pos<-dracula_words%>%
  filter(sentiment=='positive')%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(count=n(),sentiment=first(sentiment))%>% #groups each word, which is positive (sentiment), creates 3 columns
  arrange(count)%>%
  top_n(10, wt=count)   # return top 10 records according to some column, in this case, count column

dracula_pos
```

We then want to classify each word in the 'word' column as a factor, not a character and store it back into the data frame we have been working with..
```{r}
class(dracula_pos$word)

dracula_pos$word<-factor(dracula_pos$word,levels=dracula_pos$word)
```

Finally, we will graph our positive sentiments

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=dracula_pos,aes(x=word,y=count),stat='identity')+
  coord_flip()
```


##Negative Sentiments

We will now use the same code as above, but using the negative words. We won't include the word 'miss' , because that is not used as a negative word but rather a prefix to a name. 

```{r}
dracula_neg<-dracula_words%>%
  filter(sentiment=='negative')%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(count=n(),sentiment=first(sentiment))%>% 
  arrange(count)%>%
  filter(word != 'miss')%>%
  top_n(10, wt=count) 

tail(dracula_neg, n=20)

dracula_neg$word<-factor(dracula_neg$word,levels=dracula_neg$word)

ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=dracula_neg,aes(x=word,y=count),stat='identity')+
  coord_flip()

```

Now we are ready to combine the graphs into 1.

```{r}
dracula_comp<-rbind(dracula_pos, dracula_neg) #rbind allows you to put one graph on top of other.. You can still see which words are positive and negative
```

And time to plot!

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=dracula_comp,aes(x=word,y=count, fill=sentiment, color = sentiment),stat='identity')+
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = 'free_y')+      #what column disinguishes the 2 groups...in this case, the sentiment column
  coord_flip()+                                       #scales = 'free_y' -> splits the y axis into the correct graph
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('#170b42','#10e0f5'))+   #first # is negative color, second is positive                                             
  scale_color_manual(values=c('#10e0f5','#170b42'))
```
