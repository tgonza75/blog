<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h3>A wordcloud is a weighted list, in visual design. It is an image of words put together, and the size of each word depends on it’s frequency, whether it be in a book or an article. In this post, you will learn how to use a playwright from the Gutenberg database, to make a wordcloud of the most frequently used words in the book ‘Peter Pan’.</h3>
<p>We first need to import our libraries we will be using:</p>
<p>Since Gutenberg has a huge list of novels within, and for this post, we just want to work with 1 single novel, Peter Pan, we can run the following code to detect the exat book we are looking for:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gutenberg_works(str_detect(title,&#39;Peter Pan&#39;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 8
##   gutenberg_id
##          &lt;int&gt;
## 1         1332
## 2        24012
## 3        39755
## # ... with 7 more variables: title &lt;chr&gt;, author &lt;chr&gt;,
## #   gutenberg_author_id &lt;int&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, gutenberg_bookshelf &lt;chr&gt;,
## #   rights &lt;chr&gt;, has_text &lt;lgl&gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>peter_pan&lt;-gutenberg_download(39755)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Determining mirror for Project Gutenberg from http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Using mirror http://aleph.gutenberg.org</code></pre>
<p>Next, we want to split apart each line of text into words. We can use the function unnest_tokens() to do so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>words_df&lt;-peter_pan%&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)

words_df</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9,479 x 2
##    gutenberg_id         word
##           &lt;int&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;
##  1        39755 illustration
##  2        39755         with
##  3        39755          the
##  4        39755       spring
##  5        39755        comes
##  6        39755        wendy
##  7        39755          the
##  8        39755        story
##  9        39755           of
## 10        39755        peter
## # ... with 9,469 more rows</code></pre>
<p>We also want to get rid of any common words, such as “a”,“the”,“and”, these are called stop_words. To delete these from showing our wordloud, we will run the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>words_df&lt;-words_df%&gt;%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word)

words_df</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3,571 x 2
##    gutenberg_id         word
##           &lt;int&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;
##  1        39755 illustration
##  2        39755       spring
##  3        39755        wendy
##  4        39755        story
##  5        39755        peter
##  6        39755          pan
##  7        39755       retold
##  8        39755        fairy
##  9        39755         play
## 10        39755          sir
## # ... with 3,561 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Next, we want to count how many times each word comes up within the novel… To figure this out, we will group by each word and then count that word to get its frequency:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>word_freq&lt;-words_df%&gt;%
  group_by(word)%&gt;%
  summarize(count=n())

word_freq</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,541 x 2
##          word count
##         &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;
##  1    _colour     8
##  2    _first_     1
##  3     _hear_     1
##  4      _his_     1
##  5        _i_     1
##  6     _kiss_     1
##  7     _like_     1
##  8       _me_     1
##  9 _thimbles_     1
## 10          1     2
## # ... with 1,531 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Finally, it’s time to create our wordcloud! We will use a minimum frequency of 8 times a word has to appear, so we can depict a good wordcloud.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wordcloud(word_freq$word,word_freq$count,min.freq=8)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/Wordcloud_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>One final decision, depending on your personality…We can use the wordcloud2 package to make this a little bit more colorful and pretty.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wordcloud2(word_freq,background=&#39;black&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in if (class(data) == &quot;table&quot;) {: the condition has length &gt; 1 and
## only the first element will be used</code></pre>
