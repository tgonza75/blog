Now that you have, hopefully, read the first post... You can now have a better understanding of how writing a code. Let's try a new query to run. Again, let's bring our packages in with library.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now suppose we want to just see the homerun's Babe Ruth has had during his time on the New York Yankees. For this query, we can run the following code:

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(playerID=='ruthba01',teamID=='NYA')
```
